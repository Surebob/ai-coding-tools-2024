### Best for Privacy: **Tabnine** or **Continue.dev**
For regulated industries or privacy-conscious developers, Tabnine's on-premise deployment and Continue.dev's local model support are unmatched.

### Best for Enterprises: **GitHub Copilot** or **Amazon Q**
- **GitHub Copilot:** Best for general enterprise development
- **Amazon Q:** Best if you're heavily invested in AWS

### Best for Autonomous Development: **Devin** or **Replit Agent**
- **Devin:** Most advanced but very limited access
- **Replit Agent:** More accessible, great for prototypes

### Best for UI Development: **v0.dev**
No competition for generating React/Next.js components quickly.

### Best for Terminal Users: **Aider**
If you live in the terminal, Aider's Git integration and workflow are perfect.

### Rising Stars to Watch
1. **Windsurf:** Brand new but promising agentic features
2. **Supermaven:** Impressive 1M token context
3. **bolt.new:** Full-stack in browser is compelling
